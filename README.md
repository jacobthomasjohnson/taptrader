# Tap Trader

**Tap Trader** is an idle-meets-markets game: prices tick, you tap, fortunes swing.  
Buy low, sell high, and expand your portfolio while you sleep.

- **Live commodity ticker** with volatility curves that feel *almost* real.
- **One-tap trades** + instant P/L readout—no spreadsheets required.
- **Upgrade tree** boosts leverage, unlocks new markets, and automates clicks.
- **Offline earnings** so your balance grows even when the tab is closed.
- **Local persistence** (browser `localStorage`)—no sign-up friction.
